For the back end database I have decide to use SQLite which is a relational data base that will illustrate the connection between classes,
I have shown in my ER Diagram. 
I specifically chose SQLite over other database programs like PostregreSQL and MySQL because of my expierence with it and it connected functionality with c# which
is what I am utiising for my proof of concept
