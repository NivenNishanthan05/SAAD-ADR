For my proof of concept I have chosen to construct it within a WPF form in c#
This differs from the theorectical models of the CMS which was designed as a web application
I have done this due to time constraints and wanting to focus on the key functionality of the system which is it's ability to handle complaints through a data base.

I have chosen to specifically use  a WPF form as I believe it to be a model that will closely relate to the deisgn I have made in documents
This is because we have a web form xaml that looks similar to what a web application would look like.
this means I can spend more time on the functionality without worrying for time consuming elements like html and css which do not illustrate
the poit sbeing made about the system architecture.
