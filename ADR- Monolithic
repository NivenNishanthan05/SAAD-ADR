I have decided to use a monolithic architecture because I believe it will be simpler and faster to create a system like this
and due to its simplicity it creates an easier to debug system as there are less points of error for the system to go wrong in.
By comparison a distributed architecture would utilise multiple api and feature a lot more modularity since that system is designed
to work with a team of coders tasked with smaller tasks, since I am working alone in this I find it the best course of action to go with monolithic architecture
